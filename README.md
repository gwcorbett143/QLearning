Questions:

What is Q Learning? What does the Q stand for (and what about the "Learning")?
Q Learning is a model-free AI learning algorithm. This means that Q Learning algorithms don't need any knowledege of their environmnet to train on. The Q represents the function of the algorithm and the reward of the code. Or, more simply, it stands for quality in a given code in terms of meeting its goal.

What is RL (Reinforcement Learning) and how does it relate to ML (Machine Learning)?
Reinforcment Learning relies on an environment to learn how to achieve a goal whereas machine learning also collects data to achieve a goal but it relies on mass data instead of its interactions with its environment. 

What does it mean for Q Learning to be "model-free"?
Model-free refers to a learning algorithm that doesn't need to learn in an environmnet. Another example of a model-free learing is Machine learning as machine learning only learns from data and not in an environment.
