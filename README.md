What is Q Learning? What does the Q stand for (and what about the "Learning")?
Q Learning is a model free AI learning algorithm. This means that Q Learning algorithms don't need any knowledege of their environmnet to train on. The Q represents the function of the algorithm and the reward of the code. 

What is RL (Reinforcement Learning) and how does it relate to ML (Machine Learning)?
What does it mean for Q Learning to be "model-free"?
What, if anything, is Q Learning often used for? (If you find any cool projects or research relating to Q Learning, feel free to link them to me!)
